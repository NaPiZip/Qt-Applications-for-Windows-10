## Objectives
This is an example of a simple Qt application for Windows 10 which is shows the Potential Field Method for path planning which is based on the following [paper](https://www.business-sweden.se/contentassets/fcac981bfd224e609363bc7fc56889f3/discover-autonomous-driving-potential-in-japan.pdf).

I am creating this application in order to practice the following topics:<br>
- Graphical user interfaces (GUI) design with Qt 5.10+
- Using different chart types for creation of quick visualizations in Qt
- C++ development with focus on object oriented programming (OOP)

## Introduction
This section covers the basic content of the Potential field method.


## Conclusions
Answers to the following questions:
  - What was good?
  - What was bad?
  - What would I change next time?

## Future
Additional things I would like to improve?
